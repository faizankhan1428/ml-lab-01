# ML Exercise 1 - Linear Regression | NumPy

This notebook demonstrates how to implement **Linear Regression from scratch** using only NumPy.

### 🔍 What’s Inside:
- Generate synthetic regression data
- Implement gradient descent manually
- Visualize predictions and loss curve

### 🎯 Learning Goal:
Understand how linear models learn weights by minimizing Mean Squared Error using gradient descent.

### 🚀 Extensions:
- Add polynomial features
- Experiment with different learning rates and iterations
